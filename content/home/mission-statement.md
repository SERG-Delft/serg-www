The mission of the TU Delft Software Engineering Research Group (SERG) is to:

- Develop a deep understanding of how people build and evolve software systems;

- Develop novel methods, techniques, theories, and tools that advance the way in which software is built and adjusted;

- Ensure that our research results have a lasting impact in software development practice; and

- Offer students an education that prepares them to take a leading role in complex software development projects.
