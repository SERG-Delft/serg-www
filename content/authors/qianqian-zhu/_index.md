bio: >
  I am working as a research associate/research software engineer at University of Edinburgh.
  The role of a research software engineer offers the right balance of research and practice for me. As a research software engineer, I can always learn new things from different research domains; meanwhile, I can apply my knowledge of software engineering to develop a high quality, reliable and maintainable software.
  Before that, I received masterâ€™s degree from Imperial College London in 2014 and PhD degree in Software Engineering from Delft University of Technology in 2020.
