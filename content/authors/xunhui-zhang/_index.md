bio: >
  Iâ€™m a Ph.D. Candidate in Key Laboratory of Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDL), National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), China. From 2018 to 2022 (expected).
  
  I joined the Trustie & OSSEAN Group at September 2015, advised by Prof. Huaimin Wang. Before that I graduated with a B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology from Sichuan University in 2015.
  
  My main research interests are measuring developer contribution in OSS, code clone detection and blockchain based OSS copyright protection. Before that I have worked on the developer behavior analysis and recommendation, and automatic code summarization and code search.
