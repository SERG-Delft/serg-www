In this talk, I discuss the latest research efforts in logging research spread at different stages in the lifecycle of log
data: from the challenges of implementing and maintaining log statements, processing, and analysis.
This content is based in a literature review conducted during my first year at TU Delft and it spans papers from different
fields (e.g., Machine Learning and Distributed Systems).
In addition, I share my experience at Adyen, our industry partner that process payments at a global scale for high volume
merchants like Netflix, Spotify, etc, and has been actively investing in research and development with TU Delft.
