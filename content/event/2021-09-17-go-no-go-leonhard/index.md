For my Go-No-Go I want to share with you what I worked on last year; 
I show the idea behind my first paper [Lampion](https://research.tudelft.nl/en/publications/assessing-robustness-of-ml-based-program-analysis-tools-using-met), 
my current work with [Haskell Program Repair](https://github.com/Tritlo/Endemic) and our concept for a new java bug data-set.
