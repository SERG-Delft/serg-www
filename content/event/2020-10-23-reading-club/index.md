Dear all,

In this week's reading club we want to take a closer look at the qualitative method of semi-structured interviews.
The paper combines experiences from 12 software engineering studies and discusses particularly challenging areas: effort estimation, interview skills, good interaction and appropriate tools and artifacts.
If you wanna know more:
