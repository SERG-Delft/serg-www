[Robbert Krebbers](https://robbertkrebbers.nl/) discusses his ongoing effort to scale up formal verification techniques to

 * challenging programming paradigms like concurrency
 * in real programmling languages like C and Rust
 
by developing mathematical foundations and usable tool implementations.
