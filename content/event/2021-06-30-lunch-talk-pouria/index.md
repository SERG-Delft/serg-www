**Abstract:** 

In this talk, I will first explain some of my previous studies as a Ph.D. student. In these studies, we introduced multiple techniques to improve automated test generation using various available information sources, such as the source code and manually-written tests. I will also talk about some of the lessons that I learned in my journey as a Ph.D. student. Finally, I briefly talk about the new topics that I am currently working on as a PostDoc.
