**Abstract:**

Code completion is an essential feature of IDEs, yet current autocompleters  are restricted to either grammar-based or NLP-based single token completions. Both approaches have significant drawbacks:  grammar-based autocompletion is very restricted  in dynamically-typed language scenarios, whereas NLP-based autocompletion  struggles to understand the semantics of the programming language, giving suggestions that ignore a developerâ€™s context. In this work, we present CodeFill, a language model for autocompletion that combines structure and naming information.
