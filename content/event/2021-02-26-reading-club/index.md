Dear all,

Join us on February the 26th, 14:00 - 15:00 on Zoom for the next **SERG Reading Club** 📖📚!
We're reviewing one of our internal papers or an exemplar paper against the [ACM SIGSOFT Empirical Standards](https://github.com/acmsigsoft/EmpiricalStandards).

The paper for this session is a work in progress by Mauricio 🙂
We'll evaluate it against the "Qualitative Surveys (Interview Studies)" Guidelines + the General Standard.

Wanna join & you are not part of our Mattermost?
Send an email to c.e.brandt /at/ tudelft.nl to get the Zoom link 😊
