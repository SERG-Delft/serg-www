**Abstract:**

In this talk, we will introduce SynTest - A framework for generating synthetic tests for programs based on JavaScript. 

One of the main use cases we have been working on lately, is smart contract testing for Solidity.
It is very important for smart contracts to be thouroughly tested since after these contracts are deployed, it is impossible to change or update them.
Hence any bugs or security exploits in the code will be in the contract for the duration of its lifetime.
In the talk, we will go over our current research work related to this topic and the improvements we have made to optimize the process of test case generation for Solidity smart contracts.

After this, we will breakdown our future plans for this tool and discuss the remaining challenges.
