_Abstract:_

The Big Code team at Facebook explores the intersection of Machine Learning, 
Software Engineering, and Programming Languages, in order to create developer tools. 
This presentation will give  an overview of our research, which includes 
topics such as code search/recommendation, program repair, test selection, 
and resolving crashes.
