_This event is hosted by the TU Delft Programming Languages Group as part of their [seminar](https://pl.ewi.tudelft.nl/seminar/2021/12/08/genetic-program-repair/)_.

**Abstract:**

This talk presents a tool for genetic program repair utilizing the rich features provided by Haskell and the available frameworks. It covers basics of program repair, genetic search and typed holes. We then look at our novel approach of type-based program repair using properties and present some of the (mixed) results we achieved. In general, the patches are cool but often too fine-grained, but we hope that they can help especially for classroom settings. The program and a sneak-preview can be found on [github](https://github.com/Tritlo/Endemic).
