In this presentation, I'll discuss the three MSc thesis defenses we have had at Adyen:

* The thesis of Henk Grent, who worked on automatically inferring constraints in large-scale APIs
* The thesis of Hendrig Sellik, who worked on a deep learning model that identifies off-by-one mistakes
* The thesis of Casper Schröder, who worked on a search-based algorithm to improve the modularization of Adyen's large codebase.

I'll also discuss what our next works will be about.
