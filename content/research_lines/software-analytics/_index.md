Introduction
------------

Modern software projects are more than just the code that comprises them: teams follow specific development processes; the code runs on servers or mobile phones and produces runtime logs; users talk about the software in forums like StackOverflow and GitHub and rate the product in app stores. The software is part of a collection of similar applications and depends on external code or service APIâ€™s to deliver its functionality. Modern software teams need data to make informed decisions that enable continuous, feedback-driven improvement.

At the Software Analytics lab, we work to make software analytics a core asset for software development teams. Our research touches topics such as computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW), big data systems, software engineering processes, software reliability, software analysis, machine learning, and data science.

Currently, we focus on the following 2 research lines, even though we are always open to new ideas:

* **Engineering for (software) analytics**: creating platforms for data ingestion, integration and querying in a streaming fashion. Related projects:
    
    * [AI4Fintech](https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl/ai4fintech/index.html) Making large software-based organizations more efficient.
    * [Codefeedr](http://codefeedr.org) A platform to ingest and process software analytics data in a streaming fashion
    * [GHTorrent](https://ghtorrent.org) Collects all data from the GitHub event API
* **Software ecosystems**: We build ecosystem-wide, versioned call graphs out of package networks to make studies such as precise security vulnerability tracking, software license tracking, data-based API evolution, etc possible.
    
    * [FASTEN](https://www.fasten-project.eu) A platform for analyzing dependency management services at the call graph level granularity
