<!-- The TU Delft Software Engineering Research Group has the following vacancies:

### PhD student in Software Testing and Validation for AI-intense Systems

The Ph.D. position will focus on the research and development of solutions to test and validate AI-intensive systems. AI-intensive systems involve multiple internal stages, pipelines, models, as well as interaction with other non-AI-based components. Often, they also process multimodal data requiring human interpretation. The question of quality assurance for AI thus is more refined than a single evaluation or testing approach, which often is seen today. In this Ph.D. project, we therefore will focus on bridging evaluation and testing methodologies from the software engineering and applied machine learning domains.

This project is a collaboration between the Multimedia Computing (MMC) Group at the Intelligent Systems (INSY) Department, and the Software Engineering Research Group (SERG) at the Software Technology (ST) Department. The INSY and ST departments closely work together in the faculty’s Computer Science research and education.

### PhD student in Software Testing

The Software Engineering Research Group (SERG) has recently acquired a NWO Vici grant called TestShift. The Vici grant is the most prestigious personal research grant from the Dutch Science Foundation NWO and will reinforce the software testing research line at Delft University of Technology.

For this project we are seeking enthusiastic Master students interested in obtaining a PhD degree in the cross-section of software testing, human computer interaction, and socio-technical factors in software engineering. The prospective PhD student is expected to do high-quality research: coming up with creative solutions, working diligently to iron out all details and getting a deeper understanding, interacting with peers around the world, but also interacting with practitioners from both the open source and industrial domain to evaluate your research.

[TestShift](https://testshiftproject.github.io/) is rooted in empirical software engineering and will make use of research methods such as ethnography, longitudinal field studies and case studies.

### PhD student for Testing Distributed Systems and Blockchains

We are looking for an enthusiastic PhD student to work on software testing for distributed systems and Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) blockchains.

Modern computation increasingly depends on large-scale distributed systems and blockchains. However, these systems are difficult to design and implement correctly. Their executions involve many sources of nondeterminism, such as the delivery order of asynchronous messages, message losses due to network failures, and process failures. Production distributed systems and blockchains must ensure correctness in the existence of unexpected executions and failures. The PhD project aims to develop program analysis and testing techniques specifically designed for detecting bugs in distributed systems and blockchains.

The project lies in the intersection of software testing, software quality, fault-tolerance, distributed systems, and blockchains. The prospective PhD student is expected to do high-quality research involving both theory and implementation: getting a deep understanding of theoretical abstractions of fault-tolerant systems and developing novel software analysis and testing techniques.
